# V1 Phase 1 Bug Report — Rustls CryptoProvider Missing in 11 Services

**Date**: 2026-05-13
**Found by**: V1 Phase 1 smoke test (`make demo-up DEMO_MODE=agent_real`)
**Severity**: 🔴 P0 blocker — every Rust service that uses mTLS panics at startup. The full demo stack cannot run.
**Effect**: Real-stack `agent_real` / `agent_real_*` demo modes are non-functional; the only working mode for end-to-end is the benchmark shim.

---

## Symptom

```
$ make demo-up DEMO_MODE=agent_real
...
[demo] core services up; running demo container (DEMO_MODE=agent_real)...
dependency failed to start: container spendguard-webhook-receiver exited (1)
make[1]: *** [demo-up] Error 1
```

Surface failure is `spendguard-webhook-receiver exited (1)`, but root cause is upstream: `ledger` and `canonical-ingest` panic immediately, then everything that depends on `ledger:50051` fails to connect (`webhook-receiver`, `sidecar`).

## Root Cause

`thread 'main' panicked at rustls-0.23.40/src/crypto/mod.rs:249:14`:

```
Could not automatically determine the process-level CryptoProvider from
Rustls crate features. Call CryptoProvider::install_default() before this
point to select a provider manually, or make sure exactly one of the
'aws-lc-rs' and 'ring' features is enabled.
```

Rustls 0.23+ removed automatic CryptoProvider selection. The previous
toolchain bump (PR #35, Rust 1.88 → 1.91) brought in this version. The
fix was applied to **3 services that were added during round-2 work**
(`outbox_forwarder`, `ttl_sweeper`, `webhook_receiver`) but **not
backported to 11 pre-existing services**.

## Affected Services

| Service | Has fix? | Crashes at startup? |
|---|:-:|:-:|
| `auth` | ❌ | likely |
| `canonical_ingest` | ❌ | ✅ confirmed |
| `control_plane` | ❌ | likely |
| `dashboard` | ❌ | likely |
| `doctor` | ❌ | likely |
| `endpoint_catalog` | ❌ | likely (nginx-only? verify) |
| `leases` | ❌ | likely |
| `ledger` | ❌ | ✅ confirmed |
| `outbox_forwarder` | ✅ | n/a |
| `retention_sweeper` | ❌ | likely |
| `sidecar` | ❌ | ✅ cascading (can't reach ledger) |
| `ttl_sweeper` | ✅ | n/a |
| `usage_poller` | ❌ | likely |
| `webhook_receiver` | ✅ | n/a (cascading dep failure) |

11 / 14 need the fix.

## Reference Fix (already applied in 3 services)

From `services/outbox_forwarder/src/main.rs`:

```rust
#[tokio::main(flavor = "multi_thread")]
async fn main() -> anyhow::Result<()> {
    rustls::crypto::aws_lc_rs::default_provider()
        .install_default()
        .map_err(|_| anyhow::anyhow!("failed to install rustls aws_lc_rs default provider"))?;

    // ... rest of main
}
```

Same pattern needs to land in the 11 affected services. **Must be the first
statement in `main()`** before any TLS-using code path.

## Recommended Fix Strategy

### Option A — Fix all 11 in one PR (recommended)

- Branch: `fix/rustls-crypto-provider-backport`
- For each of the 11 services: add the 3-line `install_default` block at top of `main()`
- Re-run V1 Phase 1 smoke test to confirm `make demo-up DEMO_MODE=agent_real` reaches the demo container
- Codex review (Tier 0)
- Merge before P2-4 LangChain PR

**Estimated work**: 30 min editing + 30-60 min re-build + smoke test = ~1.5-2.5 hours total.

### Option B — Fix only services on `agent_real` critical path

Minimum 4 services to unblock `agent_real`:
- `ledger`
- `canonical_ingest`
- `sidecar`
- `auth` (used for tenant context, may be on path)

Faster but leaves a known-broken state on other modes (ttl_sweep, control_plane operations, etc.). Not recommended — partial fixes accumulate debt.

### Option C — Add a regression test

Beyond the immediate fix, add a CI step that boots each service in dry-run mode, ensuring they don't panic on startup. Prevents this exact regression class.

## Why This Matters Strategically

This bug means the **`README.md` "Phase 5 GA hardening" status is materially
incorrect** for the on-prem / self-hosted path. The benchmark uses a `spendguard_shim/` (a minimal reservation gateway, not the real Rust sidecar) precisely because the real sidecar stack hasn't booted since the rustls bump.

**Implication for upstream PRs**: any PR claiming "Agentic SpendGuard works
with [framework X]" that gets reviewed by a maintainer who tries
`make demo-up` will see this immediately. The current state is not safe to
publish externally.

**Implication for HN launch**: HN draft (`docs/launches/hn-show-hn-draft.md`)
must hold until at least ledger + sidecar boot cleanly.

## Next Action

Open branch `fix/rustls-crypto-provider-backport`, apply the fix to all 11
services, rebuild (~30-60 min cached), re-run V1 Phase 1, then move
forward with V1 Phase 2-4.

After the fix lands, V1 can resume from Phase 1 (re-test) → Phase 2
(LangChain pure mode if missing) → Phase 3 (4 decision paths).
