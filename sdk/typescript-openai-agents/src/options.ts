// `SpendGuardAgentsOptions` — the public, LOCKED option shape for the
// OpenAI Agents TS adapter.
//
// SLICE 2 ships only the minimum surface the factory + `bracketedGetResponse`
// reserve / commit wiring need: a substrate client, the tenant id the call
// is billed to, and an optional budget scope override. The richer
// field-for-field mirror of `design.md` §4 (`windowInstanceId`, `unit`,
// `pricing`, `claimEstimator`) is INTENTIONALLY deferred to SLICE 3+:
//
//   - SLICE 3 adds `claimEstimator` + cross-language fixture extension —
//     the default estimator derived from `inner.model` lands then so this
//     slice's tests stay focused on bracket discipline / surface lock.
//   - SLICE 4-5 demo wiring picks up `unit` / `pricing` once the demo's
//     real `commitEstimated()` shape lands.
//
// Every post-SLICE-2 addition is additive-optional so the SLICE 2 lock
// holds. Mirrors the D04 SLICE 2/3 + D06 SLICE 2/3 discipline exactly —
// minimal surface first, additive expansion at the slice that actually
// needs the field.
//
// All field names are camelCase per review-standards.md §3.

 * ```ts
 * import { withSpendGuard, runContext } from "@spendguard/openai-agents";
 * import { Agent, Runner } from "@openai/agents";
 * import { SpendGuardClient, newUuid7 } from "@spendguard/sdk";
 *
 * const client = new SpendGuardClient({ ... });
 * await client.connect();
 * await client.handshake();
 *
 * const guarded = withSpendGuard(innerModel, {
 *   client,
 *   tenantId: "tenant-prod",
 * });
 * const agent = new Agent({ name: "demo", model: guarded });
 *
 * const runId = newUuid7();
 * await runContext({ runId }, () => Runner.run(agent, "hello"));
 * ```
